Hello everyone! 

This is the place where I am documenting my progress on creating a personal portfolio website. I'm so excited to share this journey with everyone as I learn to navigate GitHub, Jekyll, and web design. Currently the webpage has the bare minimum strucutre for a blog post section, homepage, projects, and an about me.

Stay tuned for more updates!

Best regards,
Angela
