# Welcome to My Blog!

Hello everyone! 

This is the place where I am posting about my professional and academic life on my personal portfolio website. I'm so excited to share this journey with everyone as I learn to navigate my studies, internships, and community programs. Here are some of the things you can expect in the future:  

- The intersection of my passions for computer science, astronomy, and community outreach.
- Projects that I have worked on throughout the years
- My current community involvement and programs
- My journey as a women in STEM and the challenges I've overcome

Stay tuned for more updates!

Best regards,  

Angela
