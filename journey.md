## Challenges

Growing up in a rural community where education resources were scarce and there was not enough funding in the school budget to support enrichment opportunities in STEM, I learned to value every learning opportunity and to create my own. In order to satiate my desire to acquire proficiency in knowledge and skills, I researched about the subjects, particular information about the Milky Way galaxy and books about science experiments, at the local library. From those challenges, I persevered and developed my study skills to learn, qualities that I believe are essential for success.

Even though I was considered to be one of the 'smart' students during school, I was not treated with the same respect when collaborating in group projects because I was a timid, young female. When I was a part of a team to design and implement a solar powered STEM garden in my community, I had several ideas of making it a community wide project for members to create recycled water bottle fountains and flowers to beautify the green and teach people the importance of reusing materials; however, my ideas were marginalized to the louder males that were in the group and we ended up buying all new materials for the garden. Rather than being discouraged by experiences like this it gives me motivation to fight against people who looked down on individuals like me. After the garden was made, I created my own recycled art to make a difference and encouraged youth to do the same.

## Diverse Environments

One of my first encounters working with a diverse group of individuals was during my first year at UConn SPARK camp. For one of our engineering design focused projects, we had to create a health app. Each of the strong women that were in my group came from a distinct background that all had different opinions on what was the most prevalent health matter. In the end we were all able to come together and present our ZAAP app, which would aid nicotine users in the slow reduction of the drug while managing the withdrawal symptoms and their overall well being.

Another time I had the opportunity to work with youth delegates from across the United States as well as its territories was during the National 4-H Conference. For our roundtable discussion we were tasked with inventing a plan for the Smithsonian Institution to provide more inclusive internships and present our research to the agency. As each of the roundtable members represented their respective states and territories, we each brought forth the top reasons from our regions on how internships could be made more accessible to everyone, based on what we experienced and witnessed. In the end we successfully pitched our solutions to the agency and were congratulated on our ingenious ideas and how they looked forward to implementing some of them in the future.
